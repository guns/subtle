Install
-------

subtle has the following dependencies:

 1. Ruby[1] (>=1.9)
 2. Rake[2] (>=0.8)
 3. X11[3] (>=6.8.2)

Stable releases can be found here[4]. If you like you can clone the Mercurial[5] repository
and install the developer version as followed:

 1. hg clone http://hg.subforge.org/subtle
 2. cd subtle
 3. rake [options]
 4. rake install

The installer will copy the files to following XDG[6] default path: (see: rake help)

 * Binaries   -> /usr/bin
 * Configs    -> /etc/xdg/subtle
 * Extension  -> (Ruby Dir)/subtle

The paths can be easily changed (see: rake help) and are printed after config has finished.

On start subtle[7] will check if a config file is available in the typical XDG paths and
use it. A local config is preferred over a system wide. (see: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME) Then it will
have a look for sublets[8] in the XDG paths too and load them accordingly. (see $XDG_DATA_HOME)

 * To create a user config just create '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/subtle' and copy the latest config from
   the 'dist' folder into it.
 * To enable sublets[8] create '$XDG_DATA_HOME/subtle/sublets' and create symlinks to the sublets[8].
   (Load order is alphabetically)

Always compare your existing config with the one of the repository/tarball to get the latest options.
