Install
-------
subtle has the following dependencies:

1. SCons[1] (>=0.97)
2. Lua[2] (>=5.1)
3. X11[3] (>=6.8.2)

Currently there is no stable release of subtle available.
If you like you can clone the Mercurial repository and install
the developer version as followed:

1. hg clone http://hg.scrapping.cc/subtle
2. cd subtle
3. scons
4. scons install

Per default subtle will be installed with /usr/local as prefix.
This can easily be changed. (See: sconsâ€”help)

Therefore subtle will load the systemwide config and every sublets
that is in the sublets path. (/usr/local/share/subtle/sublets)

That may not be suitable for every user, so just create ~/.subtle
and copy the latest config and the desired sublets into it.

Always compare your existing config with the one of the repository
to get the latest options.
