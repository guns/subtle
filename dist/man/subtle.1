.SH NAME
subtle - a grid-based manual tiling window manager

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B subtle
.RB [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
subtle is a grid-based manual tiling window manager with a strong focus on easy
but customizable look and feel. In comparison to other tiling windows managers,
subtle has no automatic tiling of the screen size in any way, instead windows are
arranged according to positions inside of a grid - these positions are called
gravities.

.P
For better understanding of gravities, the layout of the grid is per default 
oriented on the numpad but can be changed in the config. That means that the 5 on
the numpad is center, the 7 the upper left corner and so on. The gravity of a 
window can be changed with the 
.I
:WindowGravity
grab, which is 
.B
Win+Numpad
number.

.P
Views, virtual desktops in subtle, show only windows with matching tags. Both 
windows and views can be tagged either in the config or via subtler and subtlext.
Tagging is mandatory, without a matching tag a window will never appear on a 
certain view.

.SH GETTING STARTED
To get started with subtle just follow the install instructions, have a look in
the 
.B
INSTALL
file in the tarball or check if there is a package for your 
distribution. If no package is available and you want to supply one you are 
welcome.

.P
Next step after installing is configuring. Subtle follows the XDG specifications,
therefore can the default system config be found in 
.I 
$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/subtle 
or in 
.I
/etc/xdg/subtle.
If you prefer a user based config just copy the system config to 
.I
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/subtle
or to 
.I
$HOME/.config/subtle.

.P
If you update the config please check it with subtle -k first before starting 
subtle.

Inside of subtle just press 
.IWin+Return to launch a xterm which usually starts at
center gravity. Once you have a client you can play with gravites to get used to
the system. It's really easy and straight forward, just try the various
combinations of Win+Numpad number.
