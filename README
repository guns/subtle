Install
-------
subtle has the following dependencies:

 1. Ruby[1] (>=1.8)
 2. Rake[2] (>=0.8)
 3. X11[2] (>=6.8.2)

Currently there is no stable release of subtle available.
If you like you can clone the Mercurial repository and install
the developer version as followed:

 1. hg clone http://hg.scrapping.cc/subtle
 2. cd subtle
 3. rake [options]
 4. rake install

Per default subtle will be installed with /usr/local as prefix.
This can be easily changed. (see: rake help)

Therefore subtle will load the systemwide config and every sublets
that is in the sublets path. (default: /usr/local/share/subtle/sublets)

That may not be suitable for every user, so just create ~/.subtle
and copy the latest config and the desired sublets into it.

Always compare your existing config with the one of the repository
to get the latest options.
