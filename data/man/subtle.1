.SH "NAME"
\fBsubtle\fR \- a grid\-based manual tiling window manager
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsubtle\fR \fIOPTIONS\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsubtle\fR is a grid\-based manual tiling window manager with a strong focus on easy but customizable look and feel\. In comparison to other tiling windows managers, \fBsubtle\fR has no automatic tiling of the screen size in any way, instead windows are arranged according to positions inside of a grid \- these positions are called gravities\.
.
.P
For better understanding of gravities, the layout of the grid is per default oriented on the numpad but can be changed in the config\. That means that the 5 on the numpad is center, the 7 the upper left corner and so on\. The gravity of a window can be changed with the \fI:WindowGravity\fR grab, which is \fBWin+Numpad\fR number\.
.
.P
Views, virtual desktops in \fBsubtle\fR, show only windows with matching tags\. Both windows and views can be tagged either in the config or via subtler and subtlext\.
.
.P
Tagging is \fBmandatory\fR, without a matching tag a window will never appear on a certain view\.

.SH "GETTING STARTED"
To get started with subtle just follow the install instructions, have a look in the \fBINSTALL\fR file in the tarball or check if there is a package for your distribution\. If no package is available and you want to supply one you are welcome\.
.
.P
Next step after installing is configuring\. \fBsubtle\fR follows the \fBXDG\fR specifications, therefore can the default system config be found in \fI$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/subtle\fR or in \fI/etc/xdg/subtle\fR\. If you prefer a user based config just copy the system config to \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/subtle\fR or to \fI$HOME/\.config/subtle\fR\.
.
.P
If you update the config please check it with \fBsubtle \-k\fR first before starting subtle\.
.
.P
Inside of \fBsubtle\fR just press \fBWin+Return\fR to launch a xterm which usually starts at center gravity\. Once you have a client you can play with gravites to get used to the system\. It\'s really easy and straight forward, just try the various combinations of \fBWin+Numpad\fR number\.
