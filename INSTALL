Install
-------
subtle has the following dependencies:

 1. Ruby[1] (>=1.8)
 2. Rake[2] (>=0.8)
 3. X11[2] (>=6.8.2)

Currently there is no stable release of subtle available.
If you like you can clone the Mercurial repository and install
the developer version as followed:

 1. hg clone http://hg.scrapping.cc/subtle
 2. cd subtle
 3. rake [options]
 4. rake install

The installer will copy the files to following (XDG) default path:

 Binaries   -> /usr/bin
 Configs    -> /etc/xdg/subtle
 Sublets    -> /usr/share/subtle
 Extension  -> (Ruby Dir)/subtle

The path can be easily changed (see: rake help) and are printed
after config has finished.

On start subtle will check if a config file and sublets are available
in the typical XDG path and fall back to the systemwide files.
(see: $XDG_DATA_HOME, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME)

Always compare your existing config with the one of the repository
to get the latest options.
